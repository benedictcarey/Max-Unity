# Max-Unity
Adapted scripts from a range of sources for transmitting data from Max 8 to Unity via socket connections
Credit to David Kim-Boyle and Ico Bukvic for some of the work in here. I don't claim to have written all of this code, it's a big ol' frankenstein that I've adapted for my purposes. If you feel like you'd rather not have your code in here then let me know and I'll pull it.
