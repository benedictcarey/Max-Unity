# Max-Unity
Adapted scripts from a range of sources for transmitting data from Max 8 to Unity via socket connections.
Credit to David Kim-Boyle and Ico Bukvic for some of the work in here. I don't claim to have written all of this code, it's a big ol' frankenstein that I've adapted for my purposes. If you feel like you'd rather not have your code in here then let me know and I'll pull it. CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME!!!! Lots of people seem to be interested in this of late. See mine and Georg Hajdu's paper on NetScore for some other useful tidbits.

At this stage the files are in a big Zip file since Github was fussy about me uploading so many files at once.

Have fun! Benedict
